# SAMdata
Species Assessment Monitoring tools for the Marine Resources Program at ODFW

This is one of three packages for creating SAMs. The first contains functions for extracting and tidying data from ODFW data sources. The second and third packages will analyze and plot those data, and then assemble a report.
